# Queue't - Slutprojekt

## Problem
Waiting for a free table at a busy restaurant can be frustrating and boring. Sometimes there is limited information about the waiting time which can make you uncertain about whether or not to look for another place. You can not leave the restaurant in risk of losing your place in line, even though it can be crowded. To constantly be on hold prevents you from relaxing and enjoying your company during your wait. 

With the Queuet app you can monitor your queueing in your phone and get updates about your place in line and an estimated waiting time. You can safely leave the restaurant and have a stroll down the road while you wait. A short time before your table is ready you get a direct notification and can prepare to be seated. If you happen to find another place during your wait, you can easily cancel your queueing in the app without having to return to the restaurant.
